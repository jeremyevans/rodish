module Rodish
  # Rodish::Command is the main object in Rodish's processing.
  # It handles a single command, and may have one or more
  # subcommands and/or post subcommands, forming a tree.
  #
  # Rodish's argv processing starts with the root command,
  # processing options and deleting appropriately to subcommands,
  # until the requested command or subcommand is located,
  # which is then executed.
